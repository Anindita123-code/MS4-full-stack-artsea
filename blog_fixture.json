I notice that it is easier for me to get into the small world and pay more attention to small details if I am in familiar surroundings.", "blog_content_para2": "I love to disappear into other worlds, look deep and far into a flower, follow an insect's work or see patterns, colors, shadows in rocks, clouds and leaves. Nothing else can disturb me in what can be called as \"flow\".\r\n\r\nWhen I travel, I usually bring watercolor paper and paints. They are easy to carry and even to sketch with a little charcoal. Instead of keeping a diary, there are sketches of people in a café, building or something else that catch my attention and give a memory of the place.", "blog_content_para3": "Once the inspiration has taken hold, most tools for creation work.\r\n\r\nI wish you all a relaxing summer and a free creation", "blog_date": "2021-05-25T23:58:23.610Z"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 7, "fields": {"blog_name": "What’s Old is New Again", "blog_title": "What’s Old is New Again", "blog_author": "Aaron Hockley", "blog_content": "As many folks know, I was a founding member of the Oregon Professional Photographers Association (OPPA) and served on the board of directors for several years. This year I’d taken a step back to focus on other efforts, including devoting significant time to writing a book (which is nearing completion).\r\n\r\nThis year’s board of directors featured many new faces and they didn’t realize as they took on their roles that 2020 would be a year like no other. Like every other organization, OPPA was forced to adapt its activities in response to COVID-19 and the resulting guidelines for safety.", "blog_content_para2": "Last Friday, OPPA’s President abruptly resigned from her position citing this year’s challenging environment and making reference to problematic relationships among the board. This left the organization’s board needing to appoint a new leader as the organization approaches the busiest time of its year with respect to education, competition, and other activities.\r\n\r\nIn chatting with a few folks who are currently active in the organization I realized that I could be of service, and extended and offer to the board to step in as interim President for the remainder of 2020, with the current Vice President assuming the President role in January as planned.", "blog_content_para3": "On Monday, the Board of Directors voted unanimously to name me as President for the remainder of 2020, and to serve as Immediate Past President in 2021. I thank them for their trust in me to lead OPPA at this challenging time, and I’m looking forward to refocusing the organization’s efforts on its core mission of providing professional development for serious photographers.\r\n\r\nLet’s make that happen.", "blog_date": "2021-05-26T00:03:05.369Z"}}]
